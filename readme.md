#i2c Sharp
------

C# implementation of i2c over the 3.5mm audio/microphone port. Initially targeted towards Windows Phone.

__Why?__ It gives a cheap and easy serial link to bridge between devices or to external hardware, WP + net/arduino combo should be pretty dope.

__Will it be portable?__ Ideally. Don't know how much will end up being in the portable lib, and how much will be WP specific. (Access to audio devices for one).

__Why i2c?__ It's cheap, basic, and standards are a good thing.

__Will this ever actually get finished?__    .
